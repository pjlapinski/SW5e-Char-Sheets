        "primaryAbility": "Strength",
        "flavorText": "A massive wookiee hunter prowls through the forest, hefting his vibroaxe. With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin. \r\n\r\nA gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals. \r\n\r\nFrothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.\r\n\r\nThese berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.\r\n\r\n### Primal Instinct\r\nPeople of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a berserker, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't.\r\n\r\nBerserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.\r\n\r\n### A Life of Danger\r\nNot every person deemed \"berserkers\" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.\r\n\r\nTheir courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "When creating a berserker character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your GM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?\r\n\r\nWhat led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.\r\n",

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action if you aren't wearing heavy armor.\r\n\r\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\r\n- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the berserker table.\r\n- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\r\n\r\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, you don heavy armor, or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\r\n\r\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your berserker level in the Rages column of the berserker table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.",
            "Unarmored Defense": "Also at 1st level, while you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.",
            "Reckless Attack": "Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.",
            "Danger Sense": "At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.\r\n\r\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.",
            "Fighting Style": "At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.",
            "Berserker Approach": "Also at 3rd level, you choose an approach that shapes the nature of your rage which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.",
            "Ability Score Improvement": "When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).",

            "Feral Instinct": "By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.",
            "Brutal Critical": "Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\r\n\r\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.",
            "Relentless Rage": "Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\r\n\r\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.",
            "Persistent Rage": "Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.",

            "Forcecasting": "Beginning at 1st level, in your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\n\nForce Powers Known\nYou learn 8 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the consular table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\n\nForce Points\nYou have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points column of the consular table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\n\nMax Power Level\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the consular table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\nForcecasting Ability\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier",
            "Force Recovery": "Also at 1st level, you have learned to regain some of your energy by briefly meditating. When you finish a short rest, you can regain a number of force points equal to half your consular level (rounded down) + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.",
            "Force-Empowered Casting": "At 2nd level, you gain the ability to twist your powers to suit your needs. When you cast a force power, you can expend additional force points to modify the power. You gain two of the following Empowerment options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.\r\n\r\nYou can use only one Empowerment option on a power when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.\n\nCareful Power\nWhen you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the power's full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional force point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.\n\nDistant Power\nWhen you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 additional force point to double the range of the power.\r\n\r\nWhen you cast a power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional force point to make the range of the power 30 feet.\n\nExtended Power\nWhen you cast a power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 additional force point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.\n\nHeightened Power\nWhen you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 additional force points to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the power.\n\nImproved Power\nWhen you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional force point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.\r\n\r\nYou can use Improved Power even if you have already used a different Empowerment option during the casting of the power.\n\nLingering Power\nWhen you cast a power that requires concentration to maintain you can choose to spend 3 additional force points. If you do, when you lose concentration on the power, the power will not end until the end of your next turn.\n\nPinpoint Power\nWhen you cast a power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw you can instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.\n\nQuickened Power\nWhen you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 additional force points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.\n\nRefocused Power\nWhen you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power you can use your reaction and spend 2 force points to automatically succeed on the saving throw. You can use this option even if you have already used a different Empowerment option during the casting of the power.\n\nTwinned Power\nWhen you cast a power that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of additional force points equal to the power's level to target a second creature in range with the same power (1 force point if the power is at-will).",
            "Force Shield": "Also at 2nd level, you learn how to defend yourself purely through your strength with the Force. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in Force energy. Until the start of your next turn, you have a bonus to AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of +1). This includes the triggering attack.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 11th, and 17th level in this class. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",
            "Force Affinity": "When you reach 3rd level, you've developed an affinity for one of the three aspects of the Force: the Ashla, the Bendu, or the Bogan. Choose one from the following:\n\nAshla\nWhen you successfully cast a light side power, either your or the target's (your choice) hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to the power's level. This effect lasts for 1 minute. You can only have one instance of this effect active at a time.\n\nBendu\nYou can add both your Wisdom and Charisma modifier to your maximum number of force points, instead of just one.\n\nBogan\nWhen you roll a 1 on a damage die for a dark side power, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1.",
            "Consular Tradition": "Also at 3rd level, you choose a consular tradition, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.",
            "Ability Score Improvement": "When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).",
            "One with the Force": "At 20th level, your attunement to the Force is absolute. Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score increases by 4. Additionally, you gain mastery over a single force power, and can cast it with little effort. Choose one 3rd-level force power that you know as your signature power. You can cast it once at 3rd level without expending force points. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nIf you want to cast it at a higher level, you must expend force points as normal."

        "flavorText": "Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby bulkhead, a Sullustan mechanic quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off. \r\n\r\nInside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety. \r\n\r\nA Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different. Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.\r\n\r\n### Behind the Curtain\r\nWhile perhaps not as intimidating as a heavily-armored trooper, or as exotic as a lighsaber-wielding guardian, engineers are no less vital to group dynamic. They are armorers and gunsmiths, electricians and welders, or any other facet to be found in facilities across the galaxy. Their work, often unsung, is what keeps starships (and their crew) intact.\r\n\r\n### Unflappable\r\nIt takes bravery for a soldier to enter a battlefield. It perhaps takes more for someone who is unarmed, and untrained in combat, to do the same. Engineers put their lives on the line for a living, whether by choice or acknowledging their plights as an occupational hazard. Whether they come from an elite training academy or learned their talents surviving in the slums, they are no strangers to danger and conflict.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "While creating your engineer character, consider what your primary skill set is and how you use it. You could be a street-smart mechanic who taught yourself how to fix swoop bikes as a teenager. Perhaps you are the recent graduate of an esteemed medical college, or a rookie pilot in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. What is the number one skill you are known for? Why are you willing to enter battles when you have no combat training? How do you view the more adventurous members of your group, and how do they see you and your role?\r\n",

See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\n\nTech Powers Known\nYou learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\n\nTech Points\nYou have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nMax Power Level\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\nTechcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nTechcasting Focus\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or your tool proficiencies granted by this class as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.",
            "Potent Aptitude": "Also at 1st level, your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.\r\n\r\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.\r\n\r\nA creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nInfuse Item\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. \r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nThis bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.",

As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).",
            "Quick Thinking": "Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Potent Aptitude when you finish a short or long rest.",
            "Tech Mastery": "At 20th level, your mastery of technology is unrivaled. Your Constitution and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Potent Aptitude left, you regain one use."

As he prepares to leap a gap, a blaster bolt hits him in the back and renders him unconscious. His blurry vision barely makes out the figure of a masked woman who casually approaches, ready to collect her bounty.\r\n\r\nWith his muscular arms held wide, a grizzled-looking Wookiee grins to his bloodthirsty crowd. He turns back to his arena opponent just in time to see the Besalisk take a swing. He ducks, punching the four-armed fighter in the gut. Two wild haymakers later, and he stands alone as the gladiatorial champion. \r\n\r\nTaking a deep breath, a Republic soldier looks out onto the war zone waging across the frozen surface of Ilum. He grips his blaster rifle tightly then, with a nod to the dozen squad-mates beside him, he charges onto the battlefield. \r\n\r\nFighters combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the galaxy. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or brave advent-urers. They fight for glory, honor, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth, or simple for the thrill of battle.\r\n\r\n### All in a Day's Work\r\nMany fighters see adventures, raids on enemy strongholds, and dangerous missions as their jobs. Some want to defend those who can't defend themselves while others seek to use their muscle to carve their own place of importance in the galaxy. Fighters can take the form of guards, champions, bounty hunters, enforcers, mercenaries, freedom fighters, or simply armed explorers.\r\n\r\n### Code Red\r\nMost fighters come to the profession after receiving at least some amount of formal training from a military organization. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taught and well tested. A fighter may have taken up his weapon to escape a mundane life while another may be following a proud family tradition. Whatever their origins, most fighters share an unshakeable loyalty. Fighters follow orders with little hesitation, as failure can often mean death.\r\n",

Perhaps you are a gun-for-hire, traveling the galaxy in search of your next gig. What weapons do you prefer and specialize in? Who or what do you fight for? Do you have aspirations of a life beyond the battlefield, or have you been at war so long you know of nothing else?\r\n",

First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons).

On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.",

Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.",
            "Combat Superiority": "Also at 2nd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.\n\nManeuvers\nYou learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under \"Maneuvers\" below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the fighter table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.\r\n\r\nEach time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.\n\nSuperiority Dice\nYou have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the fighter table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nSaving Throws\nSome of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)\n\nManeuvers\nThe maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.\n\nCommander's Strike\nWhen you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.\n\nDisarming Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.\n\nDistracting Strike\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.\n\nEvasive Footwork\nWhen you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.\n\nFeinting Attack\nYou can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.\n\nGoading Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.\n\nLunging Attack\nWhen you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.\n\nManeuvering Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. \r\n\r\nThat creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.\n\nMenacing Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.\n\nParry\nWhen another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.\n\nPrecision Attack\nWhen you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.\n\nPushing Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.\n\nRally\nOn your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.\n\nRiposte\nWhen a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.\n\nSweeping Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.\n\nTrip Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.",

If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.",
            "Greater Extra Attack": "Beginning at 11th level, you can attack three times, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you use a bonus action to engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting, you can make two attacks, instead of one.",
            "Master of Combat": "At 20th level, you are the master of combat. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can attack four times, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn."

He rounds the corner into the prison while the lights and power are still out, urging the weakened prisoners to escape. Just then a handful of slavers arrive and ready their blasters. The man draws and ignites a white-bladed lightsaber, ready to die for the strangers behind him. \r\n\r\nA sith pureblood, clad head to toe in black and red armor, charges towards a line of soldiers. Shot after shot deflects off his armor until he reaches his prey, where he unleashes his fury in a series of devastating lightsaber sweeps. \r\n\r\nA zabrak general dramatically leaps to his soon-to-be overrun squad, landing with a flurry of lightsaber attacks. At the arrival of this powerful Jedi, the attackers fall back.\r\n\r\nGuardians are the master of the art of lightsaber combat. They focus on utilizing the everpresent power of the Force to enable devastating attacks, often single-handedly turning the tide of battle.\r\n\r\n### Protector or Destroyer\r\nAn unstoppable agent of the Force, the guardian channels the power flowing through him into his weapons. Their skills with a lightsaber are unrivalled. Subduing their enemies and bolstering their allies, the guardian uses the Force to control what happens around them.\r\n\r\n### Natural Leaders\r\nThe guardian's command of the Force lends them a powerful presence.

            "Forcecasting": "Beginning at 1st level, in your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\n\nForce Powers Known\nYou learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the guardian table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\n\nForce Points\nYou have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points column of the guardian table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\n\nMax Power Level\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\nForcecasting Ability\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier",
            "Channel the Force": "Also at 1st level, you know how to channel the Force to create a unique effect. You start with your choice of one from two such effects: Cause Harm or Lend Aid. At 3rd level, your Guardian Focus grants you an additional effect. When you use your Channel the Force, you choose which effect to create.\r\n\r\nSome Channel the Force effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your universal force save DC.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nCause Harm\nAs an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your guardian level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), or half as much on a successful one.\n\nLend Aid\nAs a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a creature within 5 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to your guardian level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). Alternatively, if the creature is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.",
            "Force-Empowered Strikes": "Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.",
            "Fighting Style": "Also at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.",
            "Guardian Aura": "When you reach 3rd level, you gain an aura of your choice, as described at the end of the class description. When you reach 10th level you can select a second aura.\n\nGuardian Auras\nThe auras are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple guardians grant the same aura, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefits of your auras.\r\n\r\nAt 10th level, the range of these auras increases to 15 feet, and at 18th level, the range of these auras increases to 30 feet.\n\nAura of Conquest\nWhenever a creature who is frightened of you starts its turn within 5 feet of you, its speed is reduced to 0 and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your guardian level.\n\nAura of Conviction\nYou and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you can't be frightened.\n\nAura of Devotion\nYou and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you can't be charmed.\n\nAura of Hatred\nYou and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you gain a bonus to the first melee weapon damage rolls you make each round equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).\n\nAura of Presence\nWhenever you or a friendly creature within 5 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).\n\nAura of Protection\nWhenever a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.\n\nAura of Vigor\nWhenever a friendly creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).\n\nAura of Warding\nYou and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have resistance to damage from force powers.",
            "Guardian Focus": "Also at 3rd level, you begin to focus your studies on a specific lightsaber form, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your focus grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.",
            "Ability Score Improvement": "When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).",
            "Extra Attack": "Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.",
            "Force Purity": "By 6th level, the Force flowing through you makes you immune to poison and disease.",
            "Improved Force-Empowered Strikes": "By 11th level, you are so in tune with the Force that all your melee weapon strikes carry the power of the Force with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage. If you also use your Force-Empowered Strikes with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Force-Empowered Strikes. The damage is the same type as the weapon's damage.",
            "Cleansing Touch": "Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action and expend a use of your Channel the Force ability to end one force power on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch."

She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.\r\n\r\nTaking a deep breath, a zabrak covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging mercenaries reach him, he exhales and a blast of negative energy courses from his hands, engulfing his foes.\r\n\r\nMoving with the silence of the night, a black-clad mirialan steps into a shadow beneath an arch and nimbly climbs to the balcony a stone's throw above her. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the warlord, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.\r\n\r\nWhatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.\r\n\r\n### The Power of Focus\r\nMonks make careful study of a mystical energy that most monastic orders call focus. This energy is an element of the power that suffuses the galaxy\ufffdspecifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this energy within themselves to create powerful effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of focus in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of focus gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.\r\n\r\n### Training and Asceticism\r\nMost monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other power.\r\n\r\nThe majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or brigands.\r\n\r\nFor a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. \r\n",
        "creatingText": "As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?\r\n\r\nConsider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?\r\n\r\nAs a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness focus, monks are typically lawful in alignment.\r\n",

            "Martial Arts": "Beginning at 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are chakrams, techblades, and any simple vibroweapons that don't have the two-handed property.\r\n\r\nYou gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:\r\n- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.\r\n- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.\r\n- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a vibrostaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.\r\n\r\n>\n\nVariant: Monks with Lightweapons\n> If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the lightweapon has a vibroweapon analogue. For instance, chakrams count as monk weapons. If a monk gains proficiency in a light ring, they could also use it as a monk weapon.",
            "Unarmored Defense": "Also at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).",
            "Focus": "Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of focus. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the monk table.\r\n\r\nYou can spend these points to fuel various focus features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.\r\n\r\nWhen you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself. You  must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.\r\n\r\nSome of your focus features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Focus save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)\n\nFlurry of Blows\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 focus point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\n\nPatient Defense\nYou can spend 1 focus point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\n\nStep of the Wind\nYou can spend 1 focus point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.",
            "Unarmored Movement": "Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Unarmored Movement column of the monk table.\r\n\r\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.",
            "Fighting Style": "Starting at 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.",
            "Deflect Missiles": "Also at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect a projectile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\r\n\r\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, and the damage is energy or ion, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 focus point to make a ranged attack as you deflect the projectile, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the projectile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.",
            "Monastic Order": "Lastly at 3rd level, you commit yourself to one monastic order, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your order grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.",
            "Ability Score Improvement": "When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).",
            "Slow Fall": "Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.",
            "Extra Attack": "Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.",
            "Stunning Strike": "Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 focus point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.",
            "Enhanced Strikes": "Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.",
            "Evasion": "At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a consular's *force storm* or an engineer's *explosion*, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.",
            "Stillness of Mind": "Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.",
            "Purity of Body": "At 10th level, your mastery of the focus flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.",
            "Tongue of the Sun and Moon": "Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the focus of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.",
            "Diamond Soul": "Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of focus grants you proficiency in all saving throws.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 focus point to reroll it and take the second result.",
            "Timeless Body": "At 15th level, your focus sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, you no longer need food or water.",
            "Empty Body": "Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 focus points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.",
            "Perfect Self": "At 20th level, you've gained perfect control over your body. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, when you roll for initiative and have no focus points remaining, you regain 2 focus points."

When two city guards appear at the exit, he smiles and reaches under the table. Before they can move in, the smuggler flips the table and opens fire. The crowd scatters in panic, giving him just enough cover to escape. \r\n\r\nA gorgeous young human dances before an intoxicated senator in his parlor.

They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience the thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous operatives are also saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations. No matter what their immediate concerns may be, survival is the name of the game.\r\n\r\n### Outside the Law\r\nOperatives don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to bad luck, poor decisions, or circumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.\r\n",

            "Reliable Talent": "By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.",

            "Stroke of Luck": "At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, if your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest."

She gives the order and her allies unleash a single coordinated attack cutting deep into their lines. Under her command the enemy is quickly routed against all odds, all according to plan.\r\n\r\nDeep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a nautolan tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.\r\n\r\nA twi'lek in fine vestments addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape. \r\n\r\nScholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.\r\n\r\n### The Pursuit of Knowledge\r\nA true scholar is never satisfied. They are always seeking out a new answer to a new question. This often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage. Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as officers in the military.\r\n\r\n### To Learn, To Know\r\nFor scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous places to find something to quench their thirst for knowledge.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have something to prove? Think about what field you wish to pursue and think of what is driving you in that direction.\r\n",

You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.\r\n\r\nEach time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.\n\nSuperiority Dice\nYou have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar table. This die changes as you gain scholar levels, as shown in the Academic Superiority column of the scholar table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. \r\n\r\nYou regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nSaving Throws\nSome of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nManeuvers\nThe maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.\n\nAdminister Aid\nAs an action, you can expend a superiority die to tend to a creature you can touch. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to the number rolled + your Intelligence modifier.\n\nAssess the Situation\nYou can expend one superiority die to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check as a bonus action, adding the superiority die to the check.\n\nCrippling Strike\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to cripple the creature. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll and the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.\n\nDeliberate Movement\nYou can expend one superiority die to take the Disengage action as a bonus action and ignore the effects of standard difficult terrain until the end of your turn.\n\nExploit Weakness\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.\n\nGoading Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.\n\nHeads Up\nWhen a friendly creature who can see or hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the result of the saving throw. You can use this maneuver before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.\n\nMeasured Action\nAs a reaction when you make a roll for a contested skill check, you can expend a superiority die to add to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the contested skill check roll, but before any effects of the contested skill check are determined.\n\nOne Step Ahead\nWhen you roll initiative and you are not surprised, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to your initiative.\n\nTargeted Strike\nWhen an ally makes an attack against a creature, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. You add the superiority die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.",
            "Critical Analysis": "Also at 1st level, you are able to analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a target you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.\r\n- When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Intelligence modifier to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.",
            "Discovery": "As you adventure, your studies have helped you discover new practices you can apply to your skills.\r\n\r\nAt 2nd level, you master two discoveries of your choice. Your discovery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain scholar levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries column of the scholar table.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.",
            "Sage Advice": "When you reach 2nd level, you can spend 1 minute spreading your knowledge and experience, advising those around you. When you do so, choose a skill or tool you are proficient with and a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 30 feet of you who can hear you and who can understand you. Once within the next hour, the next time each creature would make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, they may add their proficiency bonus to the roll if they are not already proficient. A creature may only benefit from this feature once. If a creature is targeted by this feature again before using it, they can choose to retain the first benefit or replace it with the new skill or tool instead.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 13th level, you regain the ability to use it after you complete a short or long rest.",
            "Expertise": "At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.\r\n\r\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.",
            "Academic Pursuit": "Also at 3rd level, you dedicate your studies towards a pursuit, which is detailed at the end of the class description. The pursuit you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 9th, and 17th level.",
            "Ability Score Improvement": "When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).",
            "Multitasker": "Starting at 5th level, you can take a second reaction each round. You can only take one reaction per turn.",
            "Calm and Collected": "Beginning at 14th level, when you make a saving throw from an effect you can see, you may gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier. \r\n\r\nOnce you have used this feature, you must wait until a short or long rest before using it again.",
            "Adaptable Intellectual": "At 18th level, you are able to effectively prepare for any mission on hand. At the end of a long rest, you may choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discover that you could learn at that level.",
            "Knowledge Unbound": "When you reach 20th level, you are the pinnacle of your pursuit. Your Intelligence score increases by 4. Your maximum for that score increases by 4. Additionally, you can use any maneuver you know without expending a superiority die, rolling a d4 instead."

        "name": "Scout",
        "summary": "Versatile combatant who blends tech powers with weapons",
        "primaryAbility": "Dexterity",
        "flavorText": "Rough and grizzled looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the quarry he knows is planning a raid on a nearby settlement. Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.\r\n\r\nAfter tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile's explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank. Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe, firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank's thick armor.\r\n\r\nGlancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he's been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.\r\n\r\nScouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded. They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes.\r\n\r\n### Deadly Hunters\r\nWarriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilization\ufffdhumanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.\r\n\r\nScouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers through utilization of a wristpad. Their powers, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A scout's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the civilization.\r\n\r\n### Independent Adventurers\r\nThough a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout's true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first\ufffdand possibly the last\ufffdline of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "As you create your scout character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, tracking together until you mastered the scout's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain\ufffdperhaps by some kind of bestial monstrosity on which you've sworn revenge? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of mercenaries. \r\n\r\nWhat's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change?\r\n\r\nWhat made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?\r\n",
        "quickBuildText": "You can make a scout quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the bounty hunter background.\r\n",

You gain the following benefits: \r\n- You ignore difficult terrain.\r\n- You add your proficiency bonus to initiative rolls.\r\n- On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.",
            "Ranger's Quarry": "Also at 1st level, you learn how to effectively read and track your prey. On your turn, you can choose a creature you can see within 120 feet and mark it as your quarry (no action required). For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Once per round, when you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can deal 1d4 additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon's damage. This die changes as you gain scout levels, as shown in the Ranger's Quarry column of the scout table.\r\n- You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it while it's on the same planet as you.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nStarting at 9th level, you can expend two uses of this feature to extend the duration to 8 hours. At 17th level, you can expend three uses to extend the duration to 24 hours.",
            "Fighting Style": "Beginning at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.",
            "Techcasting": "Also at 2nd level, you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\n\nTech Powers Known\nYou learn 4 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the scout table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\n\nTech Points\nYou have a number of tech points equal to your scout level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the scout table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nMax Power Level\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the scout table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\nTechcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +your Intelligence modifier\n\nTechcasting Focus\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.",
            "Pathfinder": "Beginning at 3rd level, you are skilled at navigating the untamed wilds. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:\r\n- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.\r\n- You can't become lost by unenhanced means.\r\n- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.\r\n- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\r\n- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.\r\n- When you make a Wisdom (Survival) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Intelligence modifier.",
            "Scout Technique": "Also at 3rd level, you choose to focus on a specific scout technique, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.",
            "Ability Score Improvement": "When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).",
            "Extra Attack": "Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.",
            "Expertise": "At 6th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.\r\n\r\nAt 14th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.",
            "Commando": "Starting at 10th level, you can take the Dash or Hide actions as a bonus action on each of your turns. Additionally, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes. \r\n\r\nWhen you attempt to hide on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden. \r\n\r\nIf you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can no longer be tracked by unenhanced means, unless you choose to leave a trail.",
            "Combat Tech": "At 14th level, when you use your action to cast a tech power, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.",
            "Supreme Awareness": "At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. \r\n\r\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.",
            "Foe Slayer": "At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, once on each of your turns, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied."

As his quarry walks past, he presses the hilt of his lightsaber to the back of their head, quickly toggling it on-and-off. He is gone before the corpse hits the ground.\r\n\r\nThe togruta dashes across the battlefield, doublesaber deflecting blaster shots to the ground. She pulls her wounded padawan to her feet, and guides her away from the warzone.\r\n\r\nGreen-bladed lightsaber a blur, the cathar ferociously presses the attack. With each strike, she guides her opponent closer to the ravine's edge. A flurry of blows followed by a quick *force push* and her foe tumbles over the edge.\r\n\r\nSentinels are the masters of blending force powers with weapon attacks. They weave the two together so expertly that their foes have trouble predicting them.\r\n\r\n### The Middle of the Road\r\nThe sentinel uses stealth and subterfuge to accomplish the will of the Force. Where the consular focuses on mastery of the Force and the guardian focuses on the mastery of the lightsaber, the sentinel focuses on merging the two. \r\n\r\n### Solitary Action\r\nSentinels are notoriously independent, most comfortable acting alone and without backup; where some use a team to make up for their weaknesses, the sentinel uses the Force to overcome theirs. While some take this independent streak to the extreme, they are usually accepting of authority, as long as they are allowed to carry out directions using their preferred methods.\r\n",

Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?\r\n",

            "Forcecasting": "Beginning at 1st level, in your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\n\nForce Powers Known\nYou learn 6 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the sentinel table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\n\nForce Points\nYou have a number of force points equal to your sentinel level x 3, as shown in the Force Points column of the sentinel table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\n\nMax Power Level\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the sentinel table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\nForcecasting Ability\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier",
            "Led by the Force": "Also at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn\ufffdt already include your proficiency bonus.",
            "Force-Empowered Self": "Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystical energy of the Force throughout your body. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 force point to use a Force-Empowered Self effect. Each effect uses a d4, which changes as you gain sentinel levels, as shown in the Kinetic Combat column of the sentinel table. You\r\n\r\nhave three such effects: Deflection, Double Strike, and Slow Time. You can only use each effect once per turn, and you can only use one effect per hit.\n\nDeflection\nYou can roll a Kinetic Combat die and add it to your AC against one attack before the start of your next turn.\n\nDouble Strike\nYou can roll a Kinetic Combat die and deal additional damage equal to the amount rolled.\n\nSlow Time\nYou can roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase your speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of your turn.",
            "Sentinel Ideals": "The ideals are presented in alphabetical order. You can't benefit from a Sentinel Ideal option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\n\nIdeal of the Agile\nYou gain a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Wisdom or Charisma score (your choice). When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.\n\nIdeal of the Artisan\nChoose one of your skill or tool proficiencies. When you make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to any check you make that doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as an action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next 10 minutes, the bonus increases to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier, and you can choose a second skill or tool to extend this feature to.\n\nIdeal of the Contender\nYou can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, your unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage, and you can use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of Strength for checks made to grapple a target or escape a grapple.\n\nIdeal of the Hunter\nYou gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this ideal increases its range by 30 feet.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, you can see normally in enhanced darkness, and you gain blindsight to 10 feet.\n\nIdeal of the Steadfast\nWhen you would make a melee weapon attack roll, you can instead force the target to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + any bonuses to melee weapon attack rolls). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, when a creature succeeds on the saving throw, they take half of the normal weapon damage, and when a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw, they take damage as if suffering a critical hit.\n\nIdeal of the Titan\nYou gain proficiency in medium armor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, you have advantage on ability checks and attack rolls that would forcefully move another creature, and the distance they would be moved increases by 5 feet.\n\nIdeal of the Tranquil\nWhen you finish a short or long rest, you gain a number of temporary force points equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (rounded up, your choice, minimum of one). When you would spend a force point while you have temporary force points, the temporary force points are spent first. All temporary force points are lost at the end of your next short or long rest.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as an action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. You regain a number of force points equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (rounded up, your choice, minimum of one).\n\nIdeal of the Vigorous\nWhen you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier in place of your Constitution modifier when determining the number of hit points you regain.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as an action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sentinel level (rounded down) + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).",

If you do so, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. You can wait until after you roll the d20 to use this feature, but you must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.",
            "Center of the Force": "At 20th level, you are perfectly centered with the Force. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2.
