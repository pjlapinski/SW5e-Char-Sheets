            "Droid Companion": "Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own personalized droid companion.\r\n\r\nChoose your droid, which is detailed at the end of this discipline. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to finally finish your droid.\r\n\r\nIf your droid is irreparably destroyed, or you want to interface with a different droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one droid companion at a time.\r\n\r\nYour droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:\r\n- The droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your droid acts on its own.\r\n- Your droid's level equals your engineer level, and for each engineer level you gain after 3rd, your droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.\r\n- Your droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.\r\n- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your droid's abilities also improve. Your droid can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your droid can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.\r\n- Your droid can not wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armor in order to integrate it into your droid. Your droid must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated.\r\n- Your droid is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can modify your droid. Your droid companion has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).",
            "Potent Integration": "Lastly at 3rd level, when your droid makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to give it a boost. Roll the die and add it to both the attack and damage rolls, if the attack hits.",
            "Coordinated Attack": "Beginning at 6th level, when you take the Attack action, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make a weapon attack against the same creature.",

            "Superior Droid Defense": "Starting at 18th level, whenever an attacker that your droid can see hits it with an attack, it can use its reaction to halve the attack's damage against it."

You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's implements that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 100 credits and takes 8 hours.\n\nDermal Armor\nWhile raging you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.\n\nMorbid Protrusions\nWhile raging, your unarmed strike deals 1d4 + Strength modifier kinetic damage and when you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon or unarmed strike, you can use a bonus action to make an unarmed attack. \r\n\r\nThis unarmed attack die increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.\n\nPressurised Limbs\nWhile raging, you can use your bonus action to leap up to 30 feet to an empty space you can see. When you land you deal kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier to each creature within 5 feet of where you land. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Consitution modifier (minimum of one). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\n\nTwitchlock Actuators\nWhile you're raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, you can also use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.",
            "Support Enhancement": "At 6th level you gain an additional cybernetic enhancement. Choose one of the following enhancements and gain its feature. You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's implements that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 600 credits and takes 8 hours.\n\nBody Sculpting\nYou gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand.\n\nHoldout Cavity\nYou have a shielded compartment built into your body that can be used to store and hide a light weapon or item of similar size.\n\nKrykna Anchors\nYou gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.\n\nPanspectral Optics\nYou can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty. You are able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.\n\nSupport Structure\nYour carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.",
            "More Machine than Man": "Starting at 10th level, your cybernetics allow you to become immune to poison and disease. Additionally, you ignore unenhanced difficult terrain.",
            "Final Enhancement": "At 14th level you gain a final cybernetic enhancement. Choose one of the following enhancements and gain its feature. You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's implements that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 2000 credits and takes 8 hours.\n\nHoloskin Emitters\nWhile you're raging any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.\n\nHydraulic Overrides\nWhile you're raging you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.\n\nIntegrated Boosters\nWhile raging you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.\n\nYsalamir Capacitor Mesh\nWhen you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power, you can immediately use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the source power's caster. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the target, you can immediately make one melee weapon attack against the target as a part of that reaction."

This damage cannot be reduced in any way.\n\nPenetrating Shot\nWhen you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose up to two creatures within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature(s), it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die.\r\n\r\nThe damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.\n\nPrecision Attack\nWhen you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.\n\nReturn Fire\nWhen a creature misses you with a ranged attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a ranged weapon attack against the creature.

            "Lethal Strikes": "Lastly at 3rd level, you learn how to read your foes and strikes their weak points. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike. \r\n\r\nSome of your lethal strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Lethal Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\n\nPriming Attack\nYou attempt to prime the target. The target must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the next time you deal Sneak Attack damage against the target before the end of your next turn, you roll four additional Sneak Attack dice.\n\nTarget Assessment\nYou attempt to infer crucial details about your foe. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the GM tells you two of the following characteristics of your choice:\r\n- Highest ability score\r\n- Lowest ability score\r\n- Strongest saving throw\r\n- Weakest saving throw\n\nVulnerable Strike\nYou attempt to stagger the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the next time you would make an attack roll against the target before the end of your next turn, you can instead force the target to make a saving throw with the ability score of your choice. On a failed save, the creature takes normal weapon damage and you can apply your Sneak Attack dice to the roll.",

You can apply a poison as a bonus action, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal the application of poisons. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can improve the capability of one dose of poison. To use this benefit, you must have a poisoner's kit, and the poison must be within reach. If the poison is applied before the end of your next short or long rest, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw made to resist your poison. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.",

You must spend at least 1 minute studying these three components of the person's behavior: listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. If you can only study some of these aspects (such as only having writing samples, or only audio recordings), you can mimic that aspect of the person, but not other aspects you have not studied.\r\n\r\nYour ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.",
            "Death Strike": "At 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you deal weapon damage to a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your lethal strike save DC. On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature."

You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\n\nForce Points\nYou have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\n\nMax Power Level\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\nForcecasting Ability\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability.

Add the superiority dice to the damage you deal. You or your ally gain hit points equivalent to the damage you deal to the creature. \r\n\r\nYou can be the creature hit with the attack as long as there is an ally with 5 feet of you, in which you can let it hit without rolling an attack and must choose an ally to heal with the transfusion.\n\nWeak Point Strike\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to temporarily daze the creature.

Once a creature has benefited from this feature, they must complete a long rest before they can do so again.\n\nHealth Advisor\n*Prerequisite: Physician Pursuit*\r\nWhenever a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature begins their turn, you can use your reaction to give them temporary hit points equal to one-fourth your scholar level (rounded down) + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) which last until the start of their next turn.\n\nPatient Protector\n*Prerequisite: 5th level, Physician Pursuit*\r\nWhen you attack creatures that are within 5 feet of an ally that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature, attack rolls and damage rolls made on them with a finesse or ranged weapon may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength of Dexterity.\n\nSurgical Precision\n*Prerequisite: 5th Level, Physician Pursuit* \r\nWhen you hit a creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature with a weapon attack, it takes additional damage equal to your Dexterity modifier.\n\nTend the Wounded\n*Prerequisite: Physician Pursuit* \r\nIf you or any friendly creatures you can touch regain hit points by spending one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, each of those creatures regain 1d6 extra hit points.\r\n\r\nThis die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d8 at 7th level, 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.\n\nSide Effects\n| d20 | Side Effects  |\r\n|:----:|:-------------|\r\n| 1  | The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1. |\r\n| 2  | The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze. |\r\n| 3 | The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed. |\r\n| 4 | The creature becomes one size larger or smaller. |\r\n| 5 | The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC. |\r\n| 6 | The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. | \r\n| 7 | The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.|\r\n| 8 | The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead. |\r\n| 9 | The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage. |\r\n| 10 | The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.|\r\n| 11  | The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.  |\r\n| 12  |  The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage. |\r\n| 13 | The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft. |\r\n| 14 | The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare. |\r\n| 15 | The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.|\r\n| 16 | The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion. |\r\n| 17 | The creature believes they are the chosen one. |\r\n| 18 | The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved. |\r\n| 19 | The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage. |\r\n| 20 | The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree. |"

The object lands at its feet.\n\nPenetrating Shot\nYou attempt to damage another target with the same attack. Choose a second target within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target.

You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.\n\nManeuvering Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your allies into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see  or hear you.\r\n\r\nThat creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.\n\nPushing Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.\n\nRiposte\nWhen a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.\n\nScholar's Parry\nWhen a creature damages you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Intelligence modifier.\n\nTargeted Attack\nWhen you make a weapon attack roll, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.\n\nTrip Attack\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\n\nForce Powers Known\nYou learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\n\nForce Points\nYou have a number of force points equal to your fighter level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\n\nMax Power Level\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\nForcecasting Ability\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier",

At 18th level, when you do so, your speed increases by an additional 10 feet.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

Additionally, the creature attempting to activate must make on a Constitution saving throw or take lightning damage equal to engineer level, and become shocked until the start of its next turn. On a successful save the creature takes half damage and is not shocked. Regardless of success or failure, the creature drops your modified lightsaber.\n\nBlastsaber Conversion\nIncompatible with other conversions\r\nYou heavily modify your lightweapon to allow you to make a ranged weapon attack. With this modification, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60.

Your modified lightsaber gains the finesse property.\n\nCrossguard\nYou add an energy guard at the base of your modified lightsaber's blade. While wielding your modified lightsaber, you gain a +1 bonus to your armor class against melee weapon attacks.\n\nDisruptorsaber Conversion\nIncompatible with other conversions\r\nYou modify your lightweapon, causing it to eminate a sickly green light. Your modified lightsaber loses the luminous property.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you make your first attack on your turn, you can alter the properties of your modified lightsaber.

You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\n\nSonar Pulse\nAs an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can release a wave of sound that provides feedback on your surroundings.

You expend a superiority die, and cause all creatures within a 15-foot cone to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take damage equal to the number rolled on your superiority die plus your Intelligence modifier.\n\nCharging Attack\nIf you move at least 10 feet towards your target before successfully hitting them with a melee attack, you may expend a superiority die, causing the target to take additional damage equal to the result, and forcing it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save the creature is knocked prone.\n\nElectrical Discharge\nWhen you succeed on a check to initiate or maintain a grapple, you can expend a superiority die. The creature takes lightning damage equal to the amount rolled on the die.\n\nRampage\nWhen you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use your bonus action to expend a superiority die and move up to half your speed.

Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nAdapted Hide\n**Prerequisite:** Geneticist Pursuit\r\nWhen you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you are adapted to hot or cold climates (your choice), as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you add your full Intelligence modifier, instead of half, to your AC for the duration.\n\nAtmospheric Adaptation\n**Prerequisite:** Geneticist Pursuit\r\nYou can breathe air and water. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you no longer need to breathe, and you can survive up to one hour within the vacuum of space for the duration.\n\nEnhanced Musculature\n**Prerequisite:** Geneticist Pursuit\r\nYou count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or\r\n\r\nlift. Additionally, when you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws for the duration.\n\nIcarian Mutation\n**Prerequisite:** Geneticist Pursuit\r\nYou sprout a pair of winged arms. You gain a flight speed equal to half your walking speed. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required). When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your flying speed increases to your full walking speed, and you can use your bonus action to take the Dash action for the duration.\n\nMutagenic Hardiness\n**Prerequisite:** Geneticist Pursuit \r\nYour hit point maximum increases by a number equal to your level, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, and at the beginning of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your half your scholar level (rounded down) + your Intelligence modifier for the duration.\n\nPredatory Senses\n**Prerequisite:** Geneticist Pursuit\r\nYou have darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range instead increases by 30 feet. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell for the duration. Additionally, you can track creatures that have left a scent in the last 24 hours.\n\nUnderground Adaptation\n**Prerequisite:** Geneticist Pursuit\r\nYou gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and you can tunnel through solid rock at a rate of 1 foot per round. In order to use this speed, you must have two free hands. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you gain tremorsense out to 30 feet for the duration. You can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.\n\nUnnatural Weaponry\n**Prerequisite:** Geneticist Pursuit\r\nYou sprout claws or some other natural weapon, which deal 1d4 kinetic damage on a hit. You can use your choice of your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your unarmed strikes increase to a d6 and are considered enhanced for the duration. Additionally, you deal an additional 1d4 acid, lightning, or poison damage when you hit with them."

You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\n\nTech Points\nYou have a number of tech points equal to half of your operative level (rounded up), as shown in the Tech Points column of the Saboteur Practice Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nMax Power Level\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Saboteur Practice Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\nTechcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers.

In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nTechcasting Focus\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.",

You may only have one tracker droid companion at a time.\r\n\r\nYour tracker droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:\r\n- The tracker droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your tracker droid acts on its own.\r\n- Your tracker droid's level equals your operative level, and for each operative level you gain after 3rd, your tracker droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.\r\n- Your tracker droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.\r\n- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your tracker droid's abilities also improve. Your tracker droid can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your tracker droid can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.\r\n- Your tracker droid can not wear armor or have armor integrated in its chassis.\r\n- Your tracker droid is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.",

On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.\r\n\r\nOn a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute. \r\n\r\nAt the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest."

When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to perform an upper hand technique.\r\n\r\nSome of your upper hand techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Upper Hand save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nBrutal Hit\nYou attempt to knock the target prone while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\nLow Blow\nYou attempt to stun the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of its next turn.\n\nShank Shot\nYou attempt to hamper the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, its movement speed is to 0 and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.",

You can use this maneuver before or after the creature makes saving throw, but before the GM determines whether or not the creature fails.\n\nFast Access Programs\nWhen you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that has a casting time of 1 action, you can expend a superiority die to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.\n\nFirewall\nWhen you or an ally you can see within 60 feet make a saving throw against a tech power, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the result of that saving throw.\n\nHacked Communications\nAs an action, you may expend a superiority die, and choose any number of creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you that have commlinks, headcomms, or other such communications devices. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take sonic damage equal to the number rolled on the dice + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Additionally, on a failed save, their communication devices are disabled until rebooted.\n\nOvercapacity Powers\nWhen you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, you may expend a superiority die to cast the power at a higher level, provided is does not exceed your Maximum Power Level. Roll the superiority die, and add it to the level at which you are casting the power. You can choose to cast it at this new power level or lower.\n\nRuntime Extension\nWhen a tech power you cast with a duration of 1 minute or longer reaches the end of its duration, you may expend a superiority die to extend the duration of the power a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on your superiority die.\n\nSubtle Execution\nWhen you cast a tech power, you may expend a superiority die to cast the power without any visual or auditory cues. Creatures have disadvantage on any Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) checks made to determine if you were the caster.",
            "Potent Programming": "Beginning at 6th level, when a creature succeeds on a saving throw against an at-will tech power you cast that deals damage, the creature takes half the power's damage, but suffers no additional effects of the power.",

Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nAdministrator's Log\n**Prerequisite:** Slicer Pursuit\r\nIf you spend at least 10 minutes working on a computer or terminal, you can get a full list of users who have accessed the machine within the past 24 hours. Over the course of a long rest, you may then form a facsimile of identification that would allow you to pass yourself off as that person when accessing machines.\n\nBackdoor Egress\n**Prerequisite:** Slicer Pursuit\r\nWhen you cast a tech power that affects an area and requires a saving throw, and you are inside that power's area, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement outside the area affected by the tech power, you do not have to make a saving throw to avoid its effects.\n\nIntelligence Core Override\n**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Slicer Pursuit\r\nYou can cast the *override interface* tech power at 5th level without spending tech points. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\n\nResource Appropriation\n**Prerequisite:** 11th level, Slicer Pursuit\r\nIf you reduce the target of your Critical Analysis feature to 0 hit points, and it has tech point remaining, you may choose to gain any tech points it had remaining. Your current tech points cannot exceed your tech point maximum.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\n\nSkillful Casting\n**Prerequisite:** Slicer Pursuit\r\nWhen you hit a creature with an at-will tech power that requires an attack roll, you may treat that attack roll as a weapon attack for the purpose of using maneuvers.\n\nSleeper Program\n**Prerequisite:** Slicer Pursuit\r\nWhenever you cast a tech power with a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to delay the power's activation up to a minute. When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect. You can use your reaction to activate the power at any time.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses  when you finish a long rest."
